# Script to convert CISC ID to ADIE ID in directory and file names 
# This is only tested on directories/fileÂ£s with a BIDS naming convention
# The way the script searches for the sub- ID is dependent on the characters before and after,
# which is specific to BIDS - be aware

# TODO: make this path relative to the user 

# TODO: Use something more forgiving than shutil.move? Maybe shutil.copy then delete the old dataset when 100% safe?
# shutil.move is quite desturctive in that it's deleting the old files
# and if something goes wrong halfway through a conversion, you're left with two incomplete datasets 

# TODO: Try this on edgy test cases as per H-T's previous comments (e.g. pytest)
# TODO: Figure out Github actions so i can get GH feedback on this script
# Refer to H-T's scripts for this
